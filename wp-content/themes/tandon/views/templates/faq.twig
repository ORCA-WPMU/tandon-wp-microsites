                            When utility companies and their contractors wrongfully cause a fire and harm to others they often use their tremendous resources to  fight hard in minimizing payouts to anyone who suffers a loss. Seasoned wild fire attorneys fight for you to prove the corporation is responsible and to establish the true value of your losses, including your annoyance and discomfort from this devastating event. We hire experts in fire investigation, hydrology, metallurgy, erosion, rebuilding costs, tree valuation, and personal property valuation. Working together with these experts we have the ability to reimburse you for your losses beyond what any insurance or government assistance may cover.

                            You may be underinsured for this incident or your insurance company may deny the full value you believe you are entitled to recover. Insurance companies also often do not provide reimbursement for the annoyance and discomfort you have experience. As a result, we fight to ensure those responsible for causing the fire pay the difference and ensure you are fully compensated for the loss that you suffered.
